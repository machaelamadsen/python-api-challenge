# python-api-challenge
This activity is broken into WeatherPy and VacationPy. In WeatherPy I looked at the data of many cities using the Open Weather Map API. Visuals were created to identify potential relationships based on varying distances from the equator. In VacationPy I used the Geoapify API to create visualizations. I created maps that identify hotels within ideal weather conditions.
